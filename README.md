‚ù§Ô∏è Heart Disease Prediction App
A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit and Scikit-learn to predict the risk of heart disease based on patient medical data.

üìã About The Project
This project aims to provide an intuitive interface for a heart disease prediction model. Users can input various medical parameters, and the application leverages a trained Logistic Regression model to provide a risk assessment in percentage terms, along with a qualitative interpretation (Low, Moderate, High Risk).

The model was trained on the publicly available Cleveland Clinic heart disease dataset.

‚ú® Features
Interactive and user-friendly web interface.

Input fields for all 13 key medical attributes.

Real-time prediction of heart disease risk percentage.

Clear, color-coded results with actionable advice.

Detailed explanations for each medical parameter.
